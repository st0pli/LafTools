It is derived from SHA-1, with assorted changes intended to increase its security. It produces a 160-bit output.<br><br>HAS-160 is used in the same way as SHA-1. First it divides input in blocks of 512 bits each and pads the final block. A digest function updates the intermediate hash value by processing the input blocks in turn.<br><br>The message digest algorithm consists, by default, of 80 rounds.";
