根据您的要求，下面是将代码中的自然文本提取出来，并按照要求转换为JSON格式的过程：

1. 提取的自然文本如下：

   - "GOST Decrypt"
   - "The GOST block cipher (Magma), defined in the standard GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830), is a Soviet and Russian government standard symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 64 bits. The original standard, published in 1989, did not give the cipher any name, but the most recent revision of the standard, GOST R 34.12-2015 (RFC 7801, RFC 8891), specifies that it may be referred to as Magma. The GOST hash function is based on this cipher. The new standard also specifies a new 128-bit block cipher called Kuznyechik.<br><br>Developed in the 1970s, the standard had been marked 'Top Secret' and then downgraded to 'Secret' in 1990. Shortly after the dissolution of the USSR, it was declassified and it was released to the public in 1994. GOST 28147 was a Soviet alternative to the United States standard algorithm, DES. Thus, the two are very similar in structure."
   - "Key"
   - "IV"
   - "Input type"
   - "Output type"
   - "Algorithm"
   - "Block length"
   - "sBox"
   - "Block mode"
   - "Key meshing mode"
   - "Padding"

2. 将这些文本放入一个名为`i18n`的对象中，并给它们赋值为123。

3. 翻译这些文本为中文，并替换它们的值。

下面是转换后的JSON格式：
