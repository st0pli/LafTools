      "SHA-1, or Secure Hash Algorithm 1, is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. \n\nThis is typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long. It's commonly used in various security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, and IPsec. \n\nHowever, SHA-1 is not considered secure against well-funded attackers. As such, it's recommended to use stronger hash functions like SHA-256 or SHA-3."
