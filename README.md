# Introduction 

You may wonder why we are determined to develop this toolbox if there are numerous alternatives for those commonly used tools on online websites.

Indeed, most tools in our toolbox can be found on any online website and you also can collect them easily into your favorites in the browser, such as common encryption and decryption, translation tools, generating QR codes, etc…  

However, it’s not the simplest and quickest approach to access these conversion tools, in other words, not the most comfortable and efficient way. 

Have you ever met the below issues while using those online tools?
- No Offline Accessibility.
- No Global Dark Theme.
- No Productive UI style.
- Poor Network Performance.
- Upsetting Advertisements
- Data Leakage Issue.

If the answer to any of the above is Yes, then you should have a try with our toolbox, which has 
- Open Source, No Malicious Logic.
- Lightweight Runtime(6MB RAM only).
- Full Platforms Support(Including ARMv8)
- AI native support(ChatGPT alike)
- Highly integrated with productive UI.
- Non-stop new tools in the future.
- It can also be used over the Web and Docker.
- Extra helpers: Notes, Manual, etc...

## Cool! So is it a free software?

Yes, you can follow the license but please notice an open-source software does not mean it’s a free service. 

It’s a PAID service if you’re a regular user.
It’s a FREE service if you’re a contributor.

Nearly all commercial companies will adopt a closed source code strategy to ensure their trade secrets will not be theft from. 

But since we are developing a toolbox product, which usually stands closer to your private data. For the sake of your private documents and to solace your worries while using this toolbox,  we think it’s better to provide all source codes for you to review.

Also, we believe the source codes we provided as trade secrets in our team will not be theft as it's being safeguarded by the license we have chosen from the first day on.

## Okie, so how about the pricing?

Based on our years of project experience, we truly understand that a promising project and cloud service relies on the financial support of our users and contributions from the community.

Without a proper profit model, this project will not be sustainable and surely have no stability or quality unless we place numerous advertisements, and even steal private data from users, which is not what we want.

Thus, we decided to provide a reasonable plan to sustain this project, whose pricing would not be expensive but just related to the overhead of the project.   

Pricing Table can be viewed in this Link.

Of course, there’s another option instead of just paying the bill. 

As a professional programmer, you can contribute to this project and create a pull request for this project, then you could obtain a half-yearly premium membership.

What you can do is to
- Add Unit Test
- Add New Tools
- Enhance Exist Tools
- Solve Any App Issue  
- Enhance Performance		
- Technical Implementation

With full test coverage and efforts from the CodeGen community, we are firmly convinced that the software can grow faster and stronger. 



## CopyRights
All source codes in this project are protected by the License and the copyright law in China.

You may not use any of these source codes for commercial usage unless you obtain admission from us, otherwise, we are afraid that your behavior is against the license and agreement, and then unfortunately we will be forced to take legal action.

In addition, you can technically remove the activation logic in the source code, however, please do not spread your distribution which is broken with the activation logic, otherwise, it can also be considered a violation.

Thanks for your understanding!
