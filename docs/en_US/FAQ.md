# üí° Why LafTools?

You may wonder why we are determined to develop this toolbox as there are numerous tools can be used on the Internet. Indeed, most tools we have provided can be easily found on the Internet, such as codec, formatter, translation, QR Code, etc‚Ä¶ However, it is not the most comfortable and efficient approach to use these tools.

Have you ever met the below issues while using those online tools?

- No Offline Accessibility.
- No Global Dark Theme.
- No Productive UI style.
- Poor Network Performance.
- Upsetting Advertisements.
- Data Leakage Issue.

If the answer to any of the above is yes, then you should consider trying our toolbox. It offers the following features:

- FOSS Forever
- Lightweight Runtime
- Full platform support(including ARMv8)
- Full GPT-alike support
- Highly integrated with productive UI
- Available Docker Images and Portable Edition
- Extra helpers such as notes, manuals, etc...

# üé∑ Inspiration

This project is primarily inspired by the following musicians:

- Joe Pass
- The Manhattan Transfer
- Laura Shigihara
- Asleep at the Wheel
- Khalil Fong
- Li Rong Hao
- Chet Atkins
- Les Paul

Specifically, the performance of **Satin Doll** by the virtuoso **Joe Pass** in 'An Evening With Joe Pass' (1994) has been a source of strength and confidence for me, empowering me to face any dilemma in life.

# üôã Is it a free software?

Yes, it is open-source software, and you can use it following the terms of the license. However, please note that being open-source does not necessarily mean it's entirely free of charge. While most tools can be used for free, some may incur charges related to API usage and server costs.

While we strive to provide as many services as possible for free, some features do require payment. This is because we incur costs for servers, maintenance, and other operational aspects that are essential to keep our services running smoothly and reliably. By charging for premium services, we can cover these costs and continue to offer high-quality, sustainable services. We appreciate your understanding and support.

Wait, actually there‚Äôs another option instead of just paying the bill.

With full test coverage and efforts from the LafTools community, we are firmly convinced that the software can grow faster and stronger.

# ‚úâÔ∏è A Letter to CodeGen ToolBox Users

Greetings from the CodeGen ToolBox team.

In the midst of this cold winter, we are thrilled to announce that CodeGen ToolBox has released its entire source code and has been renamed to LafTools for a more concise and specific product name. From this point forward, our team will also be known as the LafTools Team.

Despite our software now being fully open source, we remain committed to serving our premium users as before. We are deeply grateful to those who have shown us their unreserved trust and generous support by upgrading to our premium account. Rest assured, your paid services will remain unaffected, and we are continually exploring ways to enhance this product.

Our decision to completely open our source code was driven by the following reasons:

- To conduct a security reviews
- To demonstrate the void of malicious logic or backdoors
- To welcome contributions from the community
- To build a strong reputation and earn trust.

We understand your concerns about potential hacking attempts to bypass the activation logic of the software. Indeed, we acknowledge this as a potential issue. However, we have realized that LafTools should thrive by selling services, not just software licenses.

We'd like to remind you below things:

- Download our software from the official Github repository or our official website.
- Report any security issues you detect.
- Do not hesitate to submit your proposals for UI, tools, development, or any other aspects.

Lastly, we would like to express our gratitude for your time in reading this section.

Thank you.

# Why the default port is 39899

It's a magic number which is comprised of 3 + 98 + 99.

But as LafTools's author, I prefer not to tell the story for now, haha.

# üå± What's with the name? (Old explanation)

#### _The Tools for Laffin' At Life_

The name of this project is inspired by Laffin' At Life, a classic country song from 1987 by Chet Atkins that also has a special place in the author's heart.

Hopefully LafTools will make your daily tasks easier, reducing the need for overtime and helping you maintain a healthy work-life balance, let us just laffin' at life!
