**English guideline:**  
Actually, I am not able to find such an issue in other countries, it's probably caused by China mainland network issue. If you also encounter this issue, please setup a GOPROXY for your country and re-install Go extension in VSCode.  
If you still encounter this issue, feel free to raise an issue and contact us.

# For China Developers

In China mainland, it's probably having some connectivity issue while downloading deps, this section includes common cases in China.

Let's say that 127.0.0.1:7890 is your proxy server.

> If you don't have a proxy server, it's also fine as you can use mirrors for China developers, but I wouldn't list how to setup them particularly due to my limited energy and that regulation in the region where I'm living, sorry.
