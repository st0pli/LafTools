# 🙋 Is it a free software?

Yes, it is open-source software, and you can use it following the terms of the license. However, please note that being open-source does not necessarily mean it's entirely free of charge. While most tools can be used for free, some may incur charges related to API usage and server costs.

雖然我們努力免費提供盡可能多的服務，但某些功能確實需要付費。這是因為我們會產生伺服器、維護和其他營運方面的成本，這些成本對於維持我們的服務平穩可靠地運作至關重要。透過對優質服務收費，我們可以彌補這些成本並繼續提供高品質、永續的服務。感謝您的理解與支持。

等等，其實除了付帳之外還有另一個選擇。

# ✉️ A Letter to CodeGen ToolBox Users

Greetings from the CodeGen ToolBox team.

In the midst of this cold winter, we are thrilled to announce that CodeGen ToolBox has released its entire source code and has been renamed to LafTools for a more concise and specific product name. From this point forward, our team will also be known as the LafTools Team.

Despite our software now being fully open source, we remain committed to serving our premium users as before. We are deeply grateful to those who have shown us their unreserved trust and generous support by upgrading to our premium account. Rest assured, your paid services will remain unaffected, and we are continually exploring ways to enhance this product.

Our decision to completely open our source code was driven by the following reasons::

- To conduct a security reviews
- To demonstrate the void of malicious logic or backdoors
- To welcome contributions from the community
- To build a strong reputation and earn trust.

We understand your concerns about potential hacking attempts to bypass the activation logic of the software. Indeed, we acknowledge this as a potential issue. However, we have realized that LafTools should thrive by selling services, not just software licenses.

We'd like to remind you below things:

- Download our software from the official Github repository or our official website.
- Report any security issues you detect.
- Do not hesitate to submit your proposals for UI, tools, development, or any other aspects.

Lastly, we would like to express our gratitude for your time in reading this section.

Thank you.
