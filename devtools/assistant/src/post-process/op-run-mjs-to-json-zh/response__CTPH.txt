根据您的要求，以下是代码中提取的自然文本，并按照指示转换为JSON格式，然后进行中文翻译。

首先，找到的自然文本如下：

- Context Triggered Piecewise Hashing, also called Fuzzy Hashing
- can match inputs that have homologies
- Such inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes in between these sequences may be different in both content and length
- CTPH was originally based on the work of Dr. Andrew Tridgell and a spam email detector called SpamSum
- Identifying Almost Identical Files Using Context Triggered Piecewise Hashing

下面是按照您的要求整理的JSON对象：

```json
{
  "i18n": {
    "Context Triggered Piecewise Hashing, also called Fuzzy Hashing": "123",
    "can match inputs that have homologies": "123",
    "Such inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes in between these sequences may be different in both content and length": "123",
    "CTPH was originally based on the work of Dr. Andrew Tridgell and a spam email detector called SpamSum": "123",
    "Identifying Almost Identical Files Using Context Triggered Piecewise Hashing": "123"
  }
}
```

然后，根据对代码功能的理解，下面是中文翻译：

```json
{
  "i18n": {
    "Context Triggered Piecewise Hashing, also called Fuzzy Hashing": "上下文触发的分段哈希，也称为模糊哈希",
    "can match inputs that have homologies": "可以匹配具有同源性的输入",
    "Such inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes in between these sequences may be different in both content and length": "这些输入具有相同顺序的相同字节序列，尽管这些序列之间的字节在内容和长度上可能有所不同",
    "CTPH was originally based on the work of Dr. Andrew Tridgell and a spam email detector called SpamSum": "CTPH最初基于Andrew Tridgell博士的工作以及一个名为SpamSum的垃圾邮件检测器",
    "Identifying Almost Identical Files Using Context Triggered Piecewise Hashing": "使用上下文触发的分段哈希识别几乎相同的文件"
  }
}
```

最后，根据【示例1】，这里是最终的JSON输出：

```json
{
  "i18n": {
    "Context Triggered Piecewise Hashing, also called Fuzzy Hashing": "上下文触发的分段哈希，也称为模糊哈希",
    "can match inputs that have homologies": "可以匹配具有同源性的输入",
    "Such inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes in between these sequences may be different in both content and length": "这些输入具有相同顺序的相同字节序列，尽管这些序列之间的字节在内容和长度上可能有所不同",
    "CTPH was originally based on the work of Dr. Andrew Tridgell and a spam email detector called SpamSum": "CTPH最初基于Andrew Tridgell博士的工作以及一个名为SpamSum的垃圾邮件检测器",
    "Identifying Almost Identical Files Using Context Triggered Piecewise Hashing": "使用上下文触发的分段哈希识别几乎相同的文件"
  }
}
```
