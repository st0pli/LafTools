## Pre-requisites

Before you start developing this project, please ensure that you have the following SDKs and software installed. Pay close attention to the versions specified to avoid any compatibility issues. Some versions may work, but the ones listed below are recommended.

- Node v20.9.0
- Go 1.21.1
- Git Bash(for Windows)
  - Need to select "Use Git and optional Unix...." in installation.
- Visual Studio Code

Before modifying the source code, you should read the below sections to learn the architecture and technical details.

## How to launch project?

To avoid writing duplicate parts, please read [README.md](../README.md) about this section, it includes complete guideline for how to install deps and run frontend and backend project.

## How to build project?

We fully opened the source project of this project, to build this project, you can trigger below commands in Git-Bash:

```bash
./pipeline/build-all.sh
```

## VSCode Extensions for Dev

If you are going to develop this project, here are some awesome extensions for you to check that might be helpful. Note that this section is surely of no interest.

1. Prettier - Code formatter
2. TODO Highlight
3. React
4. Go
5. Golang Tools
6. Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
7. Nano ID generator
8. HTML CSS Support
9. Go To Method
10. go snippets
11. Go Outliner
12. Go Asm
13. Go Doc

## Dev && Build on VSCode

If you are going to develop or build this project, note that you should complete below steps first, otherwise, you will receive unexcepted errors.

1. Set your terminal execution path as Git Bash
2. Set an env in your system: LAFTOOLS_ROOT=${Your Actual Project Root}.
3. Install dlv and gopls for Go backend service when you launch it firstly.

## Technologies

To start developing, please check if you are familiar with the technologies we use. No need to learn all of them if not, it’s ok if you are only familiar with F/E or B/E technologies, we have unit tests and pull request workflow to ensure your changes are done properly.

We’re looking forward to your contribution.

For Front-end development:

- React
- TypeScript
- BluePrint.js
- Tailwind.css

For Back-end development:

- Go
- Node.js

For desktop/client development:

- Wails.io
- Electron
- Browser Extension

To write our docs concisely, we will not elaborate on every detail about that 3rd library here, kindly read the source code for further details.

## Specifications

### Tools Implementation

To make sure all tools are supported on all UI clients (Web, Desktop, IDE, mobile, etc…), it is recommended that we implement the logic of tools on the server side, not the client side.

For instance, if you want to convert a base64 text into plain text, we should always do the conversion on the Go server side although there’s a quicker way to do it in the browser directly, which takes user experiences and tool compatibility into consideration.

### Node Module Design

You probably noticed there’s a Node.js server module in the architecture. Why should we use Node.js in this software, isn’t it eating our memory? Aren’t we are we pursuing low memory usage?

The reason why we bring Node worker is to :

- Utilize the ecosystem for extra tools logic in Node.js
- Define system menus, extensions, and config dynamically.
- Develop extensions without restarting the Go service.

To avoid the Node worker keeps eating u machine’s memory, we adopt the below strategy:

- Run Node as a sub-process in Go.
- Only run it when there’s a necessity.
- Using WebSocket as the protocol between Go and Node.
- Terminate Node if there’s no new request for it.

For instance, when you click a button to beautify a piece of code, the client will send a request to the server side. Note that the server side is the Go service.

Then, the Go service receives and detects this request depending on the Node service, accordingly, it will:

- Check if Node is still alive.
- If not then just launch it and keep waiting until Node is active.
- Publish a job to the node worker.
- Waiting for the response from the Node worker.

Once the Node worker completes the process, it will return the data to Go(service) via WebSocket protocol.

## Code Style

To have a good software quality and strong international support, please follow the code styles as below:

- Any label, text or message in front-end or back-end project that will be visible to users should be wrriten in English, and be wrapped by Dot function. (Learn more in i18n setup).
- Any comment for your changes should also be written in English.
- Consider performance and extensibility in your code.

## About i18n Config

Please ensure all text is written in English, for instance:

```Typescript
// "leVsK" -> fragment id
// "This is a {0} project, I like {1}" -> main text
// "awesome" -> {0}
// "LafTools" -> {1}
let str: string = Dot("leVsK","This is an {0} project, I like {1}","awesome","LafTools")

console.log(str) // This is an awesome project, I like LafTools
```
