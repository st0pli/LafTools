# üí° Introduction

You may wonder why we are determined to develop this toolbox as there are numerous tools can be used on the Internet. Indeed, most tools we have provided can be easily found on the Internet, such as codec, formatter, translation, QR Code, etc‚Ä¶ However, it is not the most comfortable and efficient approach to use these tools.

Have you ever met the below issues while using those online tools?

- No Offline Accessibility.
- No Global Dark Theme.
- No Productive UI style.
- Poor Network Performance.
- Upsetting Advertisements.
- Data Leakage Issue.

If the answer to any of the above is yes, then you should consider trying our toolbox. It offers the following features:

- FOSS Forever
- Lightweight Runtime
- Full platform support(including ARMv8)
- Full GPT-alike support
- Highly integrated with productive UI
- Available Docker Images and Portable Edition
- Extra helpers such as notes, manuals, etc...
