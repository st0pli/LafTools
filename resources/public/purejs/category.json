MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4,[3] and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321. MD5 can be used as a checksum to verify data integrity against unintentional corruption. Historically it was widely used as a cryptographic hash function; however it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It remains suitable for other non-cryptographic purposes, for example for determining the partition for a particular key in a partitioned database, and may be preferred due to lower computational requirements than more recent Secure Hash Algorithms.[4]"]},{"Id":"sha1","Label":["TtyeA","SHA1"],"Description":["gh9zA","SHA-1 or Secure Hash Algorithm 1 is a cryptographic algorithm which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value."]},{"Id":"sha224","Label":["TtyeA.sha224","SHA224"],"Description":["gh9zA.sha224","SHA-224 is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input and produces a 224-bit (28-byte) hash value.
